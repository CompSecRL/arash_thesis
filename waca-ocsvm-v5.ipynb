    "Explanation: There are **49** users' data here. Naming is in the format of Username_ExperimentNumber. Please also note that it is unprocessed raw data, which includes a lot of noise etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Experiment-1: **20** participants are involved in this task and the participants were asked to type **a story** from **a set** of short and simple stories from the American Literature https://americanliterature.com/100-great-short-stories for **four minutes**. The story was chosen randomly by the participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiment-2: 20 participants are involved in this task and for this data set, all the participants were asked to type the **same text** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Tom_Sawyer for **four minutes**. For each participant, almost the same amount of data is collected as Experiment-1. This dataset is important to be able to measure the quality of the features. The collection of this dataset is quite realistic since in a real case the users could be also asked to type a given text during their CA sessions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Experiment-3: The participants are asked to type **10 different pangram sentences**. Pangrams sentences contain** all 26 letters** of the alphabet. This data set is used to test how the **letter distribution** of text affects the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiment-4: **34** participants are involved in this task and the participants were instructed to imitate someone else's typing pattern by watching the prerecorded video of the other person. For these experiments, one of the participants was recorded on video while typing a short and simple sentence for **15 seconds** from a perspective that the hand motions, smartwatch, keyboard, and the screen could be seen. Although it was not required, the perspective allowed to infer what the victim was typing by watching. This dataset was primarily used to analyze the **attacking scenarios**. It is left to the participant to type the exact same text or imitate the hand movement of the victim.\n",

    "I realized that you have mostly 4s and 10s as values on column A, but I also found 2s. What does column A represent? \n",
    "A represents the sensor type:\n",
    " \n",
    "**10 for the accelerometer\n",
    "4 for the gyroscope**\n",
    "2 for the magnetic field sensor\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find more info about sensors and constant values that are used to define the sensor type in these links:\n",
    "- https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/sensors/sensors_overview\n",
    "- https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/Sensor#TYPE_LINEAR_ACCELERATION\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, I only collected and used accelerometer and gyroscope sensor data. Magnetometer data should not be in the dataset. If there is, that means it is an **outlier**.\n",
    " \n",
    "Is column B the time stamp, is it recorded at 100HZ?\n",
    "\n",
    "In an android app, you can set the sampling rate \"SENSOR_DELAY_NORMAL, SENSOR_DELAY_UI, SENSOR_DELAY_GAME, or SENSOR_DELAY_FASTEST \" \n",
    "\n",
    "As far as I remember I used **\"SENSOR_DELAY_FASTEST\" for all sensors**, but in practice, I had a lot of issues regarding this. They **don't give a constant sampling rate**. Every time I used they were giving different sampling rates. They were giving different sampling rates for two sessions of the same user, for different users, or for different sensors. Therefore, I would recommend using the one in the practice, which you can calculate using the timestamp and the sample count. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the paper you said you have recorded both accelerometer and gyro data; but you seem to only have one of them at a time on columns C, D, and F. I am guessing 10 on column A represents accelerometer and 4 gyro, but I could be wrong. \n",
    "Also, some rows have more columns, and start with 11 on column A. What do those represent?\n",
    "Please see the explanation above. \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "In short, I would really appreciate it if you could let me know information I need to know for working with the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, as these sensors were giving me a lot of headaches because they are really not stable, I needed to perform a lot of preprocessing. I **cleaned the outliers** before further processing. I also applied some other filtering techniques such as **moving average** to obtain more smooth data. Moreover, I needed to **clean the part the users are not performing typing operation from the beginning and end**, which you can see if you plot the values, i.e., the **user stops meaning no value and then big deviations, where the user takes off the smartwatch**."
